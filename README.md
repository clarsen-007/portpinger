# portpinger
Is a IPv4 port Open or Closed?

This is a Linux BASH script.

Example:

Currently only works with TCP connections.
Old version can ping UDP ports.

./portpinger.py -s www.google.com -p 80

If you get a reply, port is open, else script says port is closed.

Please use freely and modify as required, at your own risk...
